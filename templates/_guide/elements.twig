Let’s take a look at the main places you can organize content in Craft CMS. (Much of what’s here is detailed in our starter tutorial’s [Content in Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/docs/getting-started-tutorial/configure/modeling.html) page.)


## Common Elements

![](/guide/element-types.png)

This site doesn’t have a lot of content, but these are the main types you might utilize in your own project.  
It’s where most editors would spend their time in the control panel managing content.

### Entries

The [Entries]({{ cpUrl('entries') }}) section is where most content is likely to live. Click **Entries** in the main navigation, and the **All entries** submenu will list everything in this area.

The submenu is further broken down into Craft’s major sections. (Craft calls these “Section Types.”)

#### Channels

Channels are what you’ve probably seen in any CMS: dated posts that follow a common format. Europa has a single “News Articles” channel with its timely fake announcements, but a Craft site can have as many channels as it needs.

#### Structures

Structures are like Channels with one key difference: instead of a flat, date-centric list, you can drag and drop structure entries into whatever order you’d like.

If you’ve ever used a CMS where you’ve had to edit a bunch of individual post dates to get things to appear in a specific order on the site, this is exactly what you’d use a structure for instead. You set the explicit order things should appear in by dragging them into place.

While Europa’s “Exhibits” section isn’t configured to allow nesting, your structures could allow any number of levels.

Just like those “News Articles,” you could add as many structure sections as you’d like.

#### Singles

Singles are great for one-off pages, where you know there will only ever be one. They’re a special single-entry section type, used here for pages like homepage, about, and contact page.

### Globals

[Globals]({{ cpUrl('globals') }}) are for content that may not be specific to any one entry, but used across multiple pages or throughout the site. Click **Globals** in the main navigation and you’ll see the single “Navigation” global set—that’s Craft’s name for a grouping of global fields—with two simple fields that allow customizing the items and ordering of the site’s top navigation bar.

This can be a great place for copyright information, site-wide promotional messaging, etc.

### Categories

[Categories]({{ cpUrl('categories') }}) are hierarchical taxonomies you can establish to organize content. Click **Categories** in the main navigation and you’ll see the single “News Category” group Europa uses in the “News Articles” channel we looked at earlier.

Each category has a handle you can grab to drag it into a different position. These categories, unlike the structure we looked at, allow nesting. Try grabbing a category and making it a child of one of the others.

### Assets

[Assets]({{ cpUrl('assets') }}) are files users can upload to Craft. Click **Assets** in the main navigation and you’ll see the single “Images” asset volume.

An asset volume is like a folder with a fixed name you’d establish when first setting it up. You can right-click a volume to create subfolders within it, and upload files either pressing the **Upload files** button or dragging and dropping them directly into the file listing.

An important part for developers is that each asset volume can use its own storage type: a local folder, Amazon S3, Digital Ocean Spaces, Azure Blob Storage, etc. Craft has a number of storage drivers, but content editors don’t need to know or care about the underlying infrastructure.

#### Asset Editor

Click any image file. You’ll see a detail view that includes custom **Image Alt** and **Image Caption** fields, along with the uploader and other details. Hover over the image and click the **Edit** button at the top right of the image preview.

This will launch the asset editor, where you can perform basic image manipulation and set a focal point.

The focal point selector is important for art direction because it allows the content author to designate an important area of the image. Developers can build templates or make GraphQL requests for different image sizes, and Craft will automatically crop and size those images taking the focal point into consideration. This means you shouldn’t have to upload more than one variation of an image, which can be time-saving publishing new content and vital if a site’s design changes and requires new image dimensions.

You can double-click an asset anywhere in Craft CMS to jump to the editor, and any edits or changes you make to that asset will be used throughout your site.

### Users

[Users]({{ cpUrl('users') }}) are the last major content type, even though it might seem odd to think of people as content.  
Click **Users** in the main navigation to see the “All users” list with a submenu of admins and groups.

A user is a person with a name and an email address. A user’s permissions determine what they’re able to access, which could range from nothing at all (with no control panel access) to an admin that has every available permission by default.

User groups are named permission sets you can create for assigning to different types of users, and a user can belong to zero or more groups where the permissions will be additive. You can also add to an individual user’s permissions, which can be handy if you want to give one person access to something specific without having to create another custom group just for that person.

## Custom Fields

Each of these content types—Entries, Globals, Categories, Assets, and Users—has a critical thing in common, and it’s one of the key features of Craft CMS: each one can have its own custom field layout.

Under the hood, Craft calls these things “element types,” and every element type can have however many custom fields you’d like to add to it. This means your content can be structured and stored according to your design requirements.

Put on your developer hat for a moment and have a look at **Settings** → **Sections** → **News Articles**. Its **Settings** tab describes that section’s type and how it uses URLs. Choose the **Entry Types** tab and click **News Article**. Here you’ll see the **Field Layout** editor, which is where a developer would drag the custom fields they’ve created into the field layout for that section.

You’d use this field layout editor to assign custom fields to any of those element types we just looked at.


## Finding Things


### Search

As a site’s body of content grows and evolves, it’s important to be able to find the content you need to work with.

You can quickly search through content anywhere you see a search field. You can tailor any search with Craft’s [advanced syntax](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/searching.html) and optionally have a developer configure your site to make global customizations to search behavior with Craft’s [defaultSearchTermOptions setting](https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/config/config-settings.html#defaultsearchtermoptions).

### Table Customization

Listings of Entries, Categories, Assets, and Users can all be customized with any custom submenu headings and groupings you’d prefer. You can also adjust the columns that are displayed for each entry type, making it easier to see and sort on the information that’s important for that type of content.

Click on **Entries**, for example, and then click the gear icon directly beneath the submenu. This opens a customization modal you can use to adjust your listings:

### Quick Export

The bottom right of each listing table has an **Export...** button you can use to export the listings to CSV, JSON, or XML format:

This can be useful for content audits and planning where you might need to take a step back from your content and see it in a spreadsheet or another tool.
